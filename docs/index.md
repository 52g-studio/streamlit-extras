# A Python library with useful Streamlit extras

Welcome to the **ðŸª¢ streamlit-extras** documentation. If you want to give a special touch to your Streamlit apps, you're at the right place!

This library includes > 20 functional or visual additions to Streamlit that will make your life easier or your apps nicer. We call them _extras_ and anyone's welcome to add their owns. See our [contribution guide](contributions.md).

Go ahead and **Browse Extras** in the left handside menu, and if you like them, remember, you're just a pip install away from using them:

``` py
pip install streamlit-extras
```
